Well, I've got them, but for a price...\nNamely a little bit of your time and attention:\n\n***Please try the challenges yourself before checking the answers.**\n\nCTF's are notoriously 'NP' prone. Once you've seen the answer, it's easy\nto think you could've come up with that. There is nothing wrong with looking up\nanswers, but try reflect on why you couldn't figure it out. I try to explain my\nthought process as best and brief as possible, but figuring it out yourself is\njust the best feeling, so please give it another go when you're reading this!\nI'll not include any of the flags to avoid people simply copying and pasting\nthem.\n\nWith the mommy'ing out of the way, let's get pwning.\n\n> At the time of writing, I have already completed the challenge and I'm not\n> sure what number was associated with which flag (as the website does not allow\n> me to re-enter flags). These are the flags in the order I found them.\n\n## Flag 1 - Data Baby (Enumeration)\n\nThe first flag can be found by performing a standard recon of the subdomains of\n`vulnlawyers.co.uk`.\n```bash\n$ dnsrecon -d vulnlawyers.co.uk -D ~/path/to/wordlists/subdomains.txt -t brt\n\n[*] Using the dictionary file: /home/zohar/Documents/Playground/wordlists/subdomains.txt (provided by user)\n[*] brt: Performing host and subdomain brute force against vulnlawyers.co.uk...\n[+] \tA data.vulnlawyers.co.uk 68.183.255.206\n[+] \tA www.vulnlawyers.co.uk 68.183.255.206\n[+] 2 Records Found\n```\n\nDoing a http request with `curl`, or opening the domain in your browser returns\nsome info about the API and the first flag.\n```bash\n$ curl http://data.vulnlawyers.co.uk -H \"Cookie: <your_ctf_cookie>\"\n\n{\"name\":\"VulnLawyers Website API\",\"version\":\"2.1.04\",\"flag\":\"[^FLAG^1337-DIY-1337^FLAG^]\"}\n```\n\n## Flag 2 - Browsers are Evil (Enumeration)\n\nNow that we know the different domains that are available to us, let's do some\nrecon on the different files and folders we have access to.\n```bash\n$ ffuf -w ~/Documents/Playground/wordlists/content.txt -t 1 -p 0.1 -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\" -u http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/FUZZ\n\n\n        /'___\\  /'___\\           /'___\\       \n       /\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/  __  __  /\\ \\__/       \n       \\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\      \n        \\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/      \n         \\ \\_\\   \\ \\_\\  \\ \\____/  \\ \\_\\       \n          \\/_/    \\/_/   \\/___/    \\/_/       \n\n[...]\n________________________________________________\ncss                     [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 15ms]\ndenied                  [Status: 401, Size: 1020, Words: 178, Lines: 30, Duration: 15ms]\nimages                  [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 15ms]\njs                      [Status: 301, Size: 178, Words: 6, Lines: 8, Duration: 14ms]\nlogin                   [Status: 302, Size: 1119, Words: 197, Lines: 31, Duration: 16ms]\n```\n\nSince we are (always) looking to escalate privileges, the `login` endpoint looks\nespecially interesting. Entering `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/login` in your\nbrowser will lead to a page that says **Acess is denied from your IP address**.\nShit. But take a look at where we are `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/denied`,\nwe've been rerouted. \n\nLet's take a look at what happens with our request in the browser by opening the\ndeveloper tab (often <kbd>F12</kbd>, but if you didn't know that, you might want\nto look into some other challenges). Opening the 'Network' tab (on\nFirefox, might be different on Chrome, Safari, etc.) shows that we got a `302`\ncode from the `/login` endpoint. This code specifically tells a *browser* to\nreroute to a URL given by the `Location` header [^1].\n\nBrowsers can do weird stuff, so let's try to ask `curl` what's up.\n```bash\n$ curl www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/login -H \"Cookie: ctfchallenge=<your_ctf_cookie>\"\n\n[...]\n  <div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n      <p>Access to this portal can now be found here <a href=/lawyers-only\">/lawyers-only</a></p>\n      <p>[^FLAG^TRY_ME_B*TCH^FLAG^]</p>\n  </div>\n[...]\n```\nWell, would you look at that, a flag and a hidden endpoint :eyes:! Christmas\ncame early this year.\n\nOpening the URL `http://www.vulnlawyers.co.uk/lawyers-only` will bring us to a\nlogin screen. Now the fun stuff can begin!\n\n## Flag 3 - A Bit of This and A Bit of That (Enumeration/Exploitation)\n\nThe current goal is to log in, but we lack any user data.\n\n[^1]: [302 Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/302)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
