It is about how we could make automated negotiations fairer,\nwhich required reading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided\nby my supervisor. Being very excited to learn about something else than how to\nanalyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, I started\nreading right away.\n\n## Humanities are weird\n\nTo my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy. There\nwere a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand. There was\nnever a sense of arrival; no, aha moment. Barely a problem. I'll just read more\nslowly and look up the terms. No, not so quick! It seems like everyone has their\nown definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain work,\nand don't even get me started about the difference between the European and\nAmerican usage of liberal.\n\nWhat I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it seemed like my\nunderstanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount seemed to suggest\nthat it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a\nnever-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author\nactually meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works or\nbooks on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something I\nexpected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research\npaper :confused:.\n\n## Computer science isn't human\n\nComputer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with a\nquestion and follow some logic to arrive at an answer. This, I believe, is\nprobably a result of computer science being a derivative of mathematics[^1] and\nother exact sciences. Of course, this depends on which field in computer science\nyou're exactly working in, but I think most people can agree that any computer\nscience paper (or even a tutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot\nmore confidence about the subject than scientific work in humanities.\n\nHowever, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems like the\nway information in exact sciences is presented in a way that makes a bit too\nmuch sense. We've all heard the math teacher tell us that \"You shouldn't just\nstudy the answers to the problem\". Instead, you should try and figure it out by\nmessing around, encountering dead ends, etc. Learning is messy. This, however,\nis the complete opposite of how information is presented in textbooks, papers,\nand textbooks. Giving students and the general public the idea that if you can't\nfind the answer immediately, you're doing something wrong. Now, of course,\nresearchers, teachers, and people who enjoyed a higher education know that this\nis not the case; they're familiar with the fact that learning is messy. But this\nis not a given to anyone without a master's degree, especially not to the\ngeneral public who just hear about another great scientific discovery. Bringing\nus to the 'messy' papers I had to read.\n\n[^1]: Back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics major, instead of the more engineering-oriented subject we know it as today.\n\n## Humanities make sense\n\nPhilosophers present the material exactly as they are thinking about it; you are\nforced to think with them. Of course, this doesn't make sense. Heck, when have\nyour raw thoughts ever made complete sense to another human being. Most of the\ntime, you're forced to rephrase when talking to someone about a complex topic.\nNot always, but the important thing is that it's never a clear-cut logical\nargument- and that's when you really have to start thinking about what it is you\nwant to say. That's when you're learning. At least, according to Richard\nFeynman.\n\n> **Pick a topic**—Identify a subject you are unfamiliar with, and take an inventory\n> of what you know and what you don’t know; then, “fill in the gaps.” This could\n> be through self-study, attending lectures, listening to podcasts, etc.\n> \n> **Teach someone else**—After having compiled all that knowledge, simplify it as though you\n> will be explaining the topic to someone else. **This step is really the key**.\n> Plenty of studies have demonstrated that subjects learn better and retain more\n> knowledge when they are asked to teach what they’ve learned to someone else.\n> \n> **Simplify**—Work on removing jargon and overly technical terms from the explanation\n> by breaking down the material into simple terms using your own words. This helps\n> ensure that complex concepts don’t hide behind big words that won’t be fully\n> grasped.\n> \n> **Repeat**—Iteration is key here, as it is with so many processes.\n> Continuing to teach others the material and refine the teaching method will\n> improve retention and enforce mastery of the subject.\n>\n> — Richard Feynman[^2]\n\nPresenting your information in a way that encourages the learning process as\nmuch as possible makes total sense. The value of your work inherently driving\nyour readers to think about what you are trying to say is something which, I\nthink, is vastly underestimated. Even if that means that the information isn't\neasily digestible; sometimes it shouldn't be. Now, I don't want to do a simple\nappeal to authority saying that because some smart person said this is the best\nway to learn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some\nvalue in Richard Feynman suggesting this is the most crucial step in learning.\n\n[^2]: This isn't a direct quote, but something called the 'Feynman Method'. The\n    method Richard Feynman said he used to learn about new subjects.\n\n## Computer science should strive to be more human\n\nSo, do I think we should all abandon the current state of affairs and just start\nsubmitting cryptic diaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides that just being a\nridiculous proposition, I also made gross oversimplifications and\ngeneralizations; not all philosophical write like I described before -\ndefinitely not all people doing research in humanities. I do, however, think we\nshould pay more attention to how information is presented to people.\n\nThe way an author writes can have a massive impact on how the information\npresented is perceived and digested. Writing in such a way that the reader\nactively thinks about the subject -while not discouraging them to finish the\nmaterial- is tremendously difficult, but absolutely worth it. Find the balance\nbetween vagueness and clarity. How best to find that balance is left as an\nexercise for the reader.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
