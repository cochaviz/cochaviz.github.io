It is about how we could make automated\nnegotiations fairer, which required reading papers about philosophical\nideas on fairness as provided by my supervisor. Being very excited to\nlearn about something else than how to analyze the time complexity of\nsome dynamic programming algorithm, I started reading right away.\n\n## Humanities are weird\n\nTo my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and\nwordy. There were a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn’t\nunderstand. There was never a sense of arrival; no, aha moment. Barely a\nproblem. I’ll just read more slowly and look up the terms. No, not so\nquick! It seems like everyone has their own definition of\negalitarianism, the ‘right’ interpretation of a certain work, and don’t\neven get me started about the difference between the European and\nAmerican usage of liberal.\n\nWhat I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it seemed like my\nunderstanding of the subject didn’t grow as much as the amount seemed to\nsuggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt\nlike a never-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out\nwhat the author actually meant. It’s also not as if I had never read any\nphilosophical works or books on subjects other than computer science. It\nwas, however, not something I expected to encounter in literature\nnecessary for a computer science research paper :confused:.\n\n## Computer science isn’t human\n\nComputer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with\na question and follow some logic to arrive at an answer. This, I\nbelieve, is probably a result of computer science being a derivative of\nmathematics[^1] and other exact sciences. Of course, this depends on\nwhich field in computer science you’re exactly working in, but I think\nmost people can agree that any computer science paper (or even a\ntutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot more confidence\nabout the subject than scientific work in humanities.\n\nHowever, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems\nlike the way information in exact sciences is presented in a way that\nmakes a bit too much sense. We’ve all heard the math teacher tell us\nthat “You shouldn’t just study the answers to the problem”. Instead, you\nshould try and figure it out by messing around, encountering dead ends,\netc. Learning is messy. This, however, is the complete opposite of how\ninformation is presented in textbooks, papers, and textbooks. Giving\nstudents and the general public the idea that if you can’t find the\nanswer immediately, you’re doing something wrong. Now, of course,\nresearchers, teachers, and people who enjoyed a higher education know\nthat this is not the case; they’re familiar with the fact that learning\nis messy. But this is not a given to anyone without a master’s degree,\nespecially not to the general public who just hear about another great\nscientific discovery. Bringing us to the ‘messy’ papers I had to read.\n\n## Humanities make sense\n\nPhilosophers present the material exactly as they are thinking about it;\nyou are forced to think with them. Of course, this doesn’t make sense.\nHeck, when have your raw thoughts ever made complete sense to another\nhuman being. Most of the time, you’re forced to rephrase when talking to\nsomeone about a complex topic. Not always, but the important thing is\nthat it’s never a clear-cut logical argument- and that’s when you really\nhave to start thinking about what it is you want to say. That’s when\nyou’re learning. At least, according to Richard Feynman.\n\n> **Pick a topic**—Identify a subject you are unfamiliar with, and take\n> an inventory of what you know and what you don’t know; then, “fill in\n> the gaps.” This could be through self-study, attending lectures,\n> listening to podcasts, etc.\n>\n> **Teach someone else**—After having compiled all that knowledge,\n> simplify it as though you will be explaining the topic to someone\n> else. **This step is really the key**. Plenty of studies have\n> demonstrated that subjects learn better and retain more knowledge when\n> they are asked to teach what they’ve learned to someone else.\n>\n> **Simplify**—Work on removing jargon and overly technical terms from\n> the explanation by breaking down the material into simple terms using\n> your own words. This helps ensure that complex concepts don’t hide\n> behind big words that won’t be fully grasped.\n>\n> **Repeat**—Iteration is key here, as it is with so many processes.\n> Continuing to teach others the material and refine the teaching method\n> will improve retention and enforce mastery of the subject.\n>\n> — Richard Feynman[^2]\n\nPresenting your information in a way that encourages the learning\nprocess as much as possible makes total sense. The value of your work\ninherently driving your readers to think about what you are trying to\nsay is something which, I think, is vastly underestimated. Even if that\nmeans that the information isn’t easily digestible; sometimes it\nshouldn’t be. Now, I don’t want to do a simple appeal to authority\nsaying that because some smart person said this is the best way to\nlearn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some\nvalue in Richard Feynman suggesting this is the most crucial step in\nlearning.\n\n## Computer science should strive to be more human\n\nSo, do I think we should all abandon the current state of affairs and\njust start submitting cryptic diaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides\nthat just being a ridiculous proposition, I also made gross\noversimplifications and generalizations; not all philosophical write\nlike I described before - definitely not all people doing research in\nhumanities. I do, however, think we should pay more attention to how\ninformation is presented to people.\n\nThe way an author writes can have a massive impact on how the\ninformation presented is perceived and digested. Writing in such a way\nthat the reader actively thinks about the subject -while not\ndiscouraging them to finish the material- is tremendously difficult, but\nabsolutely worth it. Find the balance between vagueness and clarity. How\nbest to find that balance is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\n[^1]: Back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics\n    major, instead of the more engineering-oriented subject we know it\n    as today.\n\n[^2]: This isn’t a direct quote, but something called the ‘Feynman\n    Method’. The method Richard Feynman said he used to learn about new\n    subjects.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
