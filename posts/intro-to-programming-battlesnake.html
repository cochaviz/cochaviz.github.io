<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this guide I’ll walk you through concepts of programming and
application development by example of an AI that will play the game
<a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/">Battlesnake</a>. The aim of this tutorial
is to help you step beyond the ‘programming a calculator’ phase. You
know what language you want to learn, have a grasp of basic syntax and
know how logic in programming works (e.g. if statements). But what now?
Well, writing an AI :sunglasses:. We will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>problem representation and solving</li>
<li>version control with <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> and
<a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a></li>
<li>some high-level concepts regarding web services and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">APIs</a></li>
<li>setting up a server with <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Battlesnake is a great place to start from. Firstly, because it touches
upon a lot of different concepts in software development. Secondly, your
AI will battle against that of other people and there are leaderboards
to show you how well it performs. This means that you can see your snake
improve with your programming abilities!</p>
<p>I can hear you ask: “Great, but what language are we gonna be
programming in?”. Since we are essentially creating a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web</a>
service](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service</a>), you can do this
in any language you want! The Battlesnake devs and the community have
created some <a href="https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects">starter
projects</a>
which will help you get started in minutes. If you language is in there,
great! Otherwise, don’t worry. I’ll be explaining everything in
<a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, but the concepts are the same so you can follow
along in any language. I understand it might be confusing to understand
what is language-specific and what isn’t, so I’ll make sure keep
concepts and implementation separate.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The tutorial assumes that you are a beginner, but that you have some
basic knowledge about programming. More specifically, you</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>have an environment</strong> in which you can write and run code (i.e. an
IDE)</li>
<li><strong>know how use logic</strong> in you programming language of choice
(e.g. if-statements)</li>
<li>know how to use any of: <strong>classes/objects/structs</strong> (if you language
supports those)</li>
<li><strong>have made a couple of small practice projects</strong> (not necessary, but
highly recommended for fluency)</li>
</ul>
<p>If some of these don’t apply to you, I would highly encourage you to
pick up a basic course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a> or
follow some tutorials on youtube. Create your first couple of little
projects, and then come back! Do feel free to keep on looking, maybe
you’re a lot smarter than you (or I) think you are.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>We will cover a wide range of topics, so I will try to keep the
structure as consistent and easy to follow as possible. Like mentioned
before, while I will be using Go to illustrate examples, I will try to
keep all language-dependent parts separate.</p>
<p>First, I’ll introduce the game, Battlesnake, rules and the different
tools we’ll need. Then we’ll touch upon web services and APIs; how our
application will communicate with the Battlesnake server. Following
that, I’ll introduce software to manage different versions of your code,
and a platform to upload your code to. Finally, we will spin up a server
which will use the code we’ve uploaded previously to run our snake on!</p>
<p>You are, of course, free to stop at any moment and resume at a later
date. Actually, I highly encourage this! Take breaks regularly,
especially if things don’t seem to work when they should… :bug:. We’ll
cover a lot of material, so buckle up, grab some snacks, and let’s get
going :rocket:!</p>
<h2>Battlesnake</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Battlesnake is a multi-player programming game played by developers
all over the world. All you need to play is a live web server that
implements the Battlesnake API.</p>
<p>— play.battlesnake.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/">Battlesnake</a> is a developer-oriented
game, meaning that everything in, about, and around the game is made by
developers, for developers. This means that there are a lot of resources
out there that can help us out. Best example is, of course, the original
<a href="https://docs.battlesnake.com/">Battlesnake documentation</a>, which I
encourage you to read and refer to whenever you’re lost before trying to
<em>DuckDuck Go</em> it.</p>
<h3>How Battlesnake works</h3>
<p>The Battlesnake game rules are simple. In the default game mode, the
goal is to be the last-snake-standing among a group of three other
snakes. Besides that, the normal rules of snake apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>don’t run into walls</li>
<li>don’t run into snakes (you and others)</li>
<li>eating food makes you grow :apple:</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some other edge-cases to consider (e.g. what do you do when
heads collide), but these don’t matter much for our purposes. Please
refer to the official documentation if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3>Creating our first snake</h3>
<p>Enough talking! Let’s create a snake! To do this, we’ll first need to
create an account. One option is to create an account with GitHub.
Choose this one. Like mentioned before, we’ll use this platform to host
our code, so we need an account for that anyway. <a href="https://github.com/signup">Create an
account</a> for GitHub, then head over to
Battlesnake to <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/login/">create an account</a>
and select the <strong>Sign in with GitHub</strong> button.</p>
<p>Awesome, now we can head over to Battlesnake to <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/account/snakes/create/">create a new
snake</a>. Give it a
name (I name my snakes after Lord of the Rings characters)! And… Huh? A
URL? Yes, a URL. This is where the fun begins. For now we’ll cancel,
since the URL is a required field, but head to next section and I’ll
explain what’s going on.</p>
<h3>How Battlesnake <em>actually</em> works</h3>
<p>The reason why we need to provide a URL when creating a snake, is
because the snake is essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web
service</a>. I briefly mentioned
this in the introduction, but now I’ll elaborate on what that actually
means.</p>
<p>To put it concretely, our snake will run on its own remote computer
(server), the Battlesnake game server will send us the current state of
the game (location of all the snake, food, size of the field, etc.) and
ask us what our next move is. We then send a response (indicated
<code>{response}</code> in the diagram), this simply contains the action: “up”,
“down”, “left”, or “right”. But for the Battlesnake server to reach us
we to tell it our location, the URL. If you would this manually, this is
the equivalent of typing the URL, let’s say <code>my-awesome-snake.dev</code>, and
appending <code>/move</code> to it, giving us <code>my-awesome-snake.dev/move</code>. This is
what we call an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_endpoint">endpoint</a>. There
is also a endpoint for indicating that we want to start to game, which
would be <code>my-awesome-snake.dev/start</code>. And one for ending the game,
<code>/end</code>. You get the idea.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/transaction-diagram.svg%20%22Transaction%20diagram%20of%20the%20requests%20and%20responses%20made%20during%20a%20Battlesnake%20game.%20Here%20to%20the%20endpoints%20%60/start%60,%20%60/move%60,%20and%20%60/end%60%22"
alt="transaction diagram" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">transaction diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can imagine, there is no real need to send any info back to the
Battlesnake server when it send a web-request to our snake on <code>/end</code>,
telling it to end the game. But we do definitely need to send a response
when we’ve been asked to make a move. Just like we really need to
receive some information about the game, for example, what moves the
others have made. The specification for what type of requests we need to
handle (does the request contain information? Do we need to send
anything back; give a response?), as well as the format that the
information is in (e.g. a two-dimensional array representing the board)
is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">Application Programming Interface, or
API</a>.</p>
<p>Having an API is great, because it means that <strong>two programs can
communicate, without them needing to know exactly how the other works</strong>.
Since the only import thing is that they know what to expect when they
ask the other something. Just as they know what to provide in order to
make sure the other can successfully perform their required task. This
is exactly the reason why you should be able to program in any language
you want! <strong>As long as you adhere to the API specification, you can
implement your snake in anything you want</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, the Battlesnake documentation also <a href="https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api">contains a specification
for the API of the snake</a>.
Go and see if you can find the endpoints mentioned before. There is
actually one more endpoint I didn’t mention, try to see if you can find
it and figure out what it does!</p>
<h2>Getting the server running</h2>
<p>All right, this is where most of the work is gonna take place, so I’ll
just tell you right now what to expect and how we’re gonna do it. First,
we’ll take one of the beginner projects that I’ve mentioned before. All
of them are on GitHub, and with just one button we can have our own
version of such a so-called <strong>template</strong> to work with. Then, we’ll make
sure we have a local version of that code. This is done with git, which
I’ll also introduce then (in short, it allows us to keep track of
different versions of our code and lets us sync our local version with a
remote one, in our case GitHub). Once we’ve got that going, we will look
at Heroku. This is a service that will host our code on a publicly
accessible URL, which will allow us to create our first snake! Once all
of this is set up we will be able to start programming our snake logic.
With that said, let’s get going!</p>
<h3>Creating your first repository</h3>
<p>Going back to the <a href="https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects">starter
projects</a>,
click on the one that you would like to use. This should bring you to
GitHub, where you will click the big green button saying <em><strong>“Use this
template”</strong></em>. Give it a name, keep it public, and click <em><strong>“Create
repository from template”</strong></em>. Congratulations! You have made your first
repository :partying_face:! “But what is a repository?”, I can hear you
ask. Well, let me explain.</p>
<h4>Git primer</h4>
<p>A repository is a folder in which <a href="">git</a> tracks changes in order to
organize the history of your code. And what is git? Well, it simply is a
tool to organize the history, or, the different versions of you code, a
<a href="">Version Control System, or VCS</a>. It allows you to <strong>commit</strong> changes
in batches, and requires you to title and describe each of these
batches, or <strong>commits</strong>. Now, let’s say you would like to see if a
particular feature would work well. You don’t want to accidentally break
your precious program, so you <strong>branch</strong> off to a different version. In
this new branch, you write your code and continue to make commits. You
are a great programmer, so your feature turns out to be a great addition
to the existing program! Now you can <strong>merge</strong> the new feature branch
with the <strong>main</strong> (from which we’ve originally branched off) one.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/git-history-diagram.svg%20%22An%20example%20of%20a%20git%20history%20tree.%20After%20the%20first%20commit%20on%20the%20%60main%60%20branch,%20a%20new%20feature%20is%20tested%20on%20a%20new%20branch.%20In%20the%20merge,%20the%20commits%20made%20to%20the%20%60new-feature%60%20branch%20are%20applied%20to%20the%20%60main%60%20branch.%22"
alt="git history diagram" />

</figure>

<p>GitHub comes in when you would like to work together with other people
(or just have a non-local backup). It is simply a repository stored on
the GitHub servers. If you want to edit code on a repository you would
first <strong>clone</strong> the repository to you local machine. In this local
version you would keep track of your changes like normal, commit similar
batches of changes and branching if need be. At any point, you can
choose to <strong>push</strong> your changes to the <strong>remote</strong> repository on GitHub.
This is why it is important to always <strong>pull</strong> before starting to code
on a collaborative project, since someone might have changed the same
code you want to work on. If you don’t do this, you might encounter
<strong>conflicts</strong> when you want to push the changes you made to the remote.</p>
<h4>Working with git</h4>
<p>Now, there are a couple of different options in with regard to
performing these actions on a local version of your new repository.
There are applications with a <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> such as</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> - easiest to use in
combination with GitHub</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a> - has a <em>ton</em> of features</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">and many more…</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I like using the command line (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git
bash</a> for Windows) to use git. If you
don’t have any experience using a <strong>command line interface (CLI)</strong>, I
suggest you take one of the options that includes a GUI. I, however,
will be giving explaining what to do using command line instructions.
Which would looks something like this</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">git add changed_file.go
git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Commit #1&quot;</span>
</code></pre><p>Here, I’m adding all my changes from a file called <code>changed_file.go</code>,
and then committing them in a new commit called <em>Commit #1</em>. If you
would like to know how to do that in your git application of choice,
simply <em>DuckDuck Go</em> something along the lines of <em>“how to add on GitHub
Desktop”</em> and <em>“how to commit on Github Desktop”</em>. It might be a little
hard at first, but I believe you’ll learn more about the application and
how to work with it if you find the solution yourself.</p>
<h3>Exploring the code base</h3>
<p>Let’s get a little taste of what we’re gonna be working with and check
if everything works as it should, before starting to set up our server.
In order to check out the code, we could of course go to repository on
GitHub and browse the code from there. But if we want to make changes,
we’ll have to have it locally. So let’s do that now.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># this will clone the repository &lt;repo&gt; of &lt;username&gt; into the folder &lt;local_repo&gt;</span>
git <span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span> git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git &lt;local_repo&gt;
</code></pre><p>This will give us a folder, which we can open with our favorite IDE
(mine is emacs). All the beginner projects have a similar structure of
which these are the most important files.</p>
<pre><code># A wildcard (*) indicates any sort of pattern (e.g. py, go, rs, etc.)
- logic.*
- main.*
- logic_test.*
</code></pre><p><code>main.*</code> contains the functions that handle the web requests. <code>logic.*</code>
contains the snake logic; how your snake responds given a game state.
<code>logic_test.*</code> contains some tests for functions defined in <code>logic.*</code>.
In the next two sections I’ll discuss the code in these files. Again, it
will be done in Go, but you should be able to follow in any language
since the structure is similar.</p>
<h4>Web requests</h4>
<p>Opening <code>main.go</code> file will show a couple of functions and structs. The
functions are for handling web requests, and the structs show how the
data should be <strong>parsed</strong> from the incoming web request. All these data
structures have to do with the <code>GameState</code> that we get from a request at
the <code>/move</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>We can see four different handlers:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">HandleIndex</span><span class="hljs-params">(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</span></span> {
  [...]
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">HandleStart</span><span class="hljs-params">(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</span></span> {
  [...]
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">HandleMove</span><span class="hljs-params">(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</span></span> {
  [...]
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">HandleEnd</span><span class="hljs-params">(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</span></span> {
  [...]
}
</code></pre><p>Each one corresponds to a different end point. Here, <code>HandleIndex</code>
corresponds to the <code>/</code>, or <strong>root</strong>, endpoint. The reason that this is
called <code>HandleIndex</code> and not <code>HandleRoot</code>, is because when you normally
type a URL, for example <code>duckduckgo.com</code>, you don’t actually go to the
root. You browser automatically starts looking for a file called
<code>index.html</code> on the corresponding website (i.e.
<code>duckduckgo.com/index.html</code>). In its simplest form, a website is nothing
more than a server that serves <code>html</code> files. Which is also why <code>/</code> is
called the root, because <strong>it is the root of the filesystem of the
server</strong>.</p>
<h4>Trying it out</h4>
<p>To check if the server runs like it should (and it should), you can run
the project in whatever IDE you have. In Go, using the command line, it
would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">go run main.go
</code></pre><pre><code class="hljs language-txt">2022/03/23 21:10:03 Starting Battlesnake Server at http://0.0.0.0:8080...
</code></pre><p>Open your browser and type in the URL at the end of the line (or,
<code>http://localhost:8080</code>, they mean the same). If everything works as it
should, you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json"><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;apiversion&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;author&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;cochaviz&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;color&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;#488A16&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;head&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;beluga&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;tail&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;curled&quot;</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre><p>This is the ‘secret’ endpoint I was hinting at in the previous chapter!
It tells us information about who made the snake (me :smile:), what it
looks like, and the version of the API. Knowing the version of the API
is important because it tells you if it even makes sense to interact
with the snake any further. If the Battlesnake game server would see a
different API version, it would probably not interact any further (maybe
show you an error when creating the snake) in order to avoid possible
errors.</p>
<p>This is essentially what the Heroku server will do. It will take the
code from GitHub and run it. The only difference is that the URL will be
different than <code>http://0.0.0.0:8080</code>. This address is actually only
accessible from your computer (hinted to by <code>localhost</code>) in order to
make sure no malicious users could gain access to your computer.
Technically you <em>could</em> host it yourself (and once you know a little bit
more about networking and hosting I would highly encourage you to do
so!), but for now Heroku is the simplest <em>and</em> safest option.</p>
<h4>Snake logic</h4>
<p>Having a look in the <code>logic.go</code> shows only a couple of functions, but a
lot of comments. This is where most of the magic will happen, at least,
in the beginning. Once you make your snake more complex, you will
inevitably restructure your project. But, it is a nice place to start
from. Let’s have a look together, but do make sure to read through the
comments first to see if you understand what they are supposed to do.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-comment">// This function is called when you register your Battlesnake on play.battlesnake.com</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// See https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/getting-started#step-4-register-your-battlesnake</span>

The aim of this tutorial\nis to help you step beyond the ‘programming a calculator’ phase. You\nknow what language you want to learn, have a grasp of basic syntax and\nknow how logic in programming works (e.g. if statements). But what now?\nWell, writing an AI :sunglasses:. We will cover:\n\n- problem representation and solving\n- version control with [git](https://git-scm.com) and\n  [GitHub](https://www.github.com)\n- some high-level concepts regarding web services and\n  [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)\n- setting up a server with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)\n\nBattlesnake is a great place to start from. Firstly, because it touches\nupon a lot of different concepts in software development. Secondly, your\nAI will battle against that of other people and there are leaderboards\nto show you how well it performs. This means that you can see your snake\nimprove with your programming abilities!\n\nI can hear you ask: “Great, but what language are we gonna be\nprogramming in?”. Since we are essentially creating a\n[web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)\nservice\\](\u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service\u003e), you can do this\nin any language you want! The Battlesnake devs and the community have\ncreated some [starter\nprojects](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects)\nwhich will help you get started in minutes. If you language is in there,\ngreat! Otherwise, don’t worry. I’ll be explaining everything in\n[Go](https://go.dev/), but the concepts are the same so you can follow\nalong in any language. I understand it might be confusing to understand\nwhat is language-specific and what isn’t, so I’ll make sure keep\nconcepts and implementation separate.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe tutorial assumes that you are a beginner, but that you have some\nbasic knowledge about programming. More specifically, you\n\n- **have an environment** in which you can write and run code (i.e. an\n  IDE)\n- **know how use logic** in you programming language of choice\n  (e.g. if-statements)\n- know how to use any of: **classes/objects/structs** (if you language\n  supports those)\n- **have made a couple of small practice projects** (not necessary, but\n  highly recommended for fluency)\n\nIf some of these don’t apply to you, I would highly encourage you to\npick up a basic course on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or\nfollow some tutorials on youtube. Create your first couple of little\nprojects, and then come back! Do feel free to keep on looking, maybe\nyou’re a lot smarter than you (or I) think you are.\n\n### Structure\n\nWe will cover a wide range of topics, so I will try to keep the\nstructure as consistent and easy to follow as possible. Like mentioned\nbefore, while I will be using Go to illustrate examples, I will try to\nkeep all language-dependent parts separate.\n\nFirst, I’ll introduce the game, Battlesnake, rules and the different\ntools we’ll need. Then we’ll touch upon web services and APIs; how our\napplication will communicate with the Battlesnake server. Following\nthat, I’ll introduce software to manage different versions of your code,\nand a platform to upload your code to. Finally, we will spin up a server\nwhich will use the code we’ve uploaded previously to run our snake on!\n\nYou are, of course, free to stop at any moment and resume at a later\ndate. Actually, I highly encourage this! Take breaks regularly,\nespecially if things don’t seem to work when they should… :bug:. We’ll\ncover a lot of material, so buckle up, grab some snacks, and let’s get\ngoing :rocket:!\n\n## Battlesnake\n\n\u003e Battlesnake is a multi-player programming game played by developers\n\u003e all over the world. All you need to play is a live web server that\n\u003e implements the Battlesnake API.\n\u003e\n\u003e — play.battlesnake.com\n\n[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) is a developer-oriented\ngame, meaning that everything in, about, and around the game is made by\ndevelopers, for developers. This means that there are a lot of resources\nout there that can help us out. Best example is, of course, the original\n[Battlesnake documentation](https://docs.battlesnake.com/), which I\nencourage you to read and refer to whenever you’re lost before trying to\n*DuckDuck Go* it.\n\n### How Battlesnake works\n\nThe Battlesnake game rules are simple. In the default game mode, the\ngoal is to be the last-snake-standing among a group of three other\nsnakes. Besides that, the normal rules of snake apply:\n\n1.  don’t run into walls\n2.  don’t run into snakes (you and others)\n3.  eating food makes you grow :apple:\n\nThere are some other edge-cases to consider (e.g. what do you do when\nheads collide), but these don’t matter much for our purposes. Please\nrefer to the official documentation if you want to learn more.\n\n### Creating our first snake\n\nEnough talking! Let’s create a snake! To do this, we’ll first need to\ncreate an account. One option is to create an account with GitHub.\nChoose this one. Like mentioned before, we’ll use this platform to host\nour code, so we need an account for that anyway. [Create an\naccount](https://github.com/signup) for GitHub, then head over to\nBattlesnake to [create an account](https://play.battlesnake.com/login/)\nand select the **Sign in with GitHub** button.\n\nAwesome, now we can head over to Battlesnake to [create a new\nsnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/account/snakes/create/). Give it a\nname (I name my snakes after Lord of the Rings characters)! And… Huh? A\nURL? Yes, a URL. This is where the fun begins. For now we’ll cancel,\nsince the URL is a required field, but head to next section and I’ll\nexplain what’s going on.\n\n### How Battlesnake *actually* works\n\nThe reason why we need to provide a URL when creating a snake, is\nbecause the snake is essentially a [web\nservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service). I briefly mentioned\nthis in the introduction, but now I’ll elaborate on what that actually\nmeans.\n\nTo put it concretely, our snake will run on its own remote computer\n(server), the Battlesnake game server will send us the current state of\nthe game (location of all the snake, food, size of the field, etc.) and\nask us what our next move is. We then send a response (indicated\n`{response}` in the diagram), this simply contains the action: “up”,\n“down”, “left”, or “right”. But for the Battlesnake server to reach us\nwe to tell it our location, the URL. If you would this manually, this is\nthe equivalent of typing the URL, let’s say `my-awesome-snake.dev`, and\nappending `/move` to it, giving us `my-awesome-snake.dev/move`. This is\nwhat we call an\n[endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_endpoint). There\nis also a endpoint for indicating that we want to start to game, which\nwould be `my-awesome-snake.dev/start`. And one for ending the game,\n`/end`. You get the idea.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/transaction-diagram.svg%20%22Transaction%20diagram%20of%20the%20requests%20and%20responses%20made%20during%20a%20Battlesnake%20game.%20Here%20to%20the%20endpoints%20%60/start%60,%20%60/move%60,%20and%20%60/end%60%22\"\nalt=\"transaction diagram\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003etransaction diagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nAs you can imagine, there is no real need to send any info back to the\nBattlesnake server when it send a web-request to our snake on `/end`,\ntelling it to end the game. But we do definitely need to send a response\nwhen we’ve been asked to make a move. Just like we really need to\nreceive some information about the game, for example, what moves the\nothers have made. The specification for what type of requests we need to\nhandle (does the request contain information? Do we need to send\nanything back; give a response?), as well as the format that the\ninformation is in (e.g. a two-dimensional array representing the board)\nis called an [Application Programming Interface, or\nAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).\n\nHaving an API is great, because it means that **two programs can\ncommunicate, without them needing to know exactly how the other works**.\nSince the only import thing is that they know what to expect when they\nask the other something. Just as they know what to provide in order to\nmake sure the other can successfully perform their required task. This\nis exactly the reason why you should be able to program in any language\nyou want! **As long as you adhere to the API specification, you can\nimplement your snake in anything you want**.\n\nOf course, the Battlesnake documentation also [contains a specification\nfor the API of the snake](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api).\nGo and see if you can find the endpoints mentioned before. There is\nactually one more endpoint I didn’t mention, try to see if you can find\nit and figure out what it does!\n\n## Getting the server running\n\nAll right, this is where most of the work is gonna take place, so I’ll\njust tell you right now what to expect and how we’re gonna do it. First,\nwe’ll take one of the beginner projects that I’ve mentioned before. All\nof them are on GitHub, and with just one button we can have our own\nversion of such a so-called **template** to work with. Then, we’ll make\nsure we have a local version of that code. This is done with git, which\nI’ll also introduce then (in short, it allows us to keep track of\ndifferent versions of our code and lets us sync our local version with a\nremote one, in our case GitHub). Once we’ve got that going, we will look\nat Heroku. This is a service that will host our code on a publicly\naccessible URL, which will allow us to create our first snake! Once all\nof this is set up we will be able to start programming our snake logic.\nWith that said, let’s get going!\n\n### Creating your first repository\n\nGoing back to the [starter\nprojects](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects),\nclick on the one that you would like to use. This should bring you to\nGitHub, where you will click the big green button saying ***“Use this\ntemplate”***. Give it a name, keep it public, and click ***“Create\nrepository from template”***. Congratulations! You have made your first\nrepository :partying_face:! “But what is a repository?”, I can hear you\nask. Well, let me explain.\n\n#### Git primer\n\nA repository is a folder in which [git]() tracks changes in order to\norganize the history of your code. And what is git? Well, it simply is a\ntool to organize the history, or, the different versions of you code, a\n[Version Control System, or VCS](). It allows you to **commit** changes\nin batches, and requires you to title and describe each of these\nbatches, or **commits**. Now, let’s say you would like to see if a\nparticular feature would work well. You don’t want to accidentally break\nyour precious program, so you **branch** off to a different version. In\nthis new branch, you write your code and continue to make commits. You\nare a great programmer, so your feature turns out to be a great addition\nto the existing program! Now you can **merge** the new feature branch\nwith the **main** (from which we’ve originally branched off) one.\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/git-history-diagram.svg%20%22An%20example%20of%20a%20git%20history%20tree.%20After%20the%20first%20commit%20on%20the%20%60main%60%20branch,%20a%20new%20feature%20is%20tested%20on%20a%20new%20branch.%20In%20the%20merge,%20the%20commits%20made%20to%20the%20%60new-feature%60%20branch%20are%20applied%20to%20the%20%60main%60%20branch.%22\"\nalt=\"git history diagram\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003egit history diagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\nGitHub comes in when you would like to work together with other people\n(or just have a non-local backup). It is simply a repository stored on\nthe GitHub servers. If you want to edit code on a repository you would\nfirst **clone** the repository to you local machine. In this local\nversion you would keep track of your changes like normal, commit similar\nbatches of changes and branching if need be. At any point, you can\nchoose to **push** your changes to the **remote** repository on GitHub.\nThis is why it is important to always **pull** before starting to code\non a collaborative project, since someone might have changed the same\ncode you want to work on. If you don’t do this, you might encounter\n**conflicts** when you want to push the changes you made to the remote.\n\n#### Working with git\n\nNow, there are a couple of different options in with regard to\nperforming these actions on a local version of your new repository.\nThere are applications with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** such as\n\n- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - easiest to use in\n  combination with GitHub\n- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - has a *ton* of features\n- [and many more…](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)\n\nPersonally, I like using the command line ([git\nbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows) to use git. If you\ndon’t have any experience using a **command line interface (CLI)**, I\nsuggest you take one of the options that includes a GUI. I, however,\nwill be giving explaining what to do using command line instructions.\nWhich would looks something like this\n\n``` bash\ngit add changed_file.go\ngit commit -m \"Commit #1\"\n```\n\nHere, I’m adding all my changes from a file called `changed_file.go`,\nand then committing them in a new commit called *Commit \\#1*. If you\nwould like to know how to do that in your git application of choice,\nsimply *DuckDuck Go* something along the lines of *“how to add on GitHub\nDesktop”* and *“how to commit on Github Desktop”*. It might be a little\nhard at first, but I believe you’ll learn more about the application and\nhow to work with it if you find the solution yourself.\n\n### Exploring the code base\n\nLet’s get a little taste of what we’re gonna be working with and check\nif everything works as it should, before starting to set up our server.\nIn order to check out the code, we could of course go to repository on\nGitHub and browse the code from there. But if we want to make changes,\nwe’ll have to have it locally. So let’s do that now.\n\n``` bash\n# this will clone the repository \u003crepo\u003e of \u003cusername\u003e into the folder \u003clocal_repo\u003e\ngit clone git@github.com:\u003cusername\u003e/\u003crepo\u003e.git \u003clocal_repo\u003e\n```\n\nThis will give us a folder, which we can open with our favorite IDE\n(mine is emacs). All the beginner projects have a similar structure of\nwhich these are the most important files.\n\n    # A wildcard (*) indicates any sort of pattern (e.g. py, go, rs, etc.)\n    - logic.*\n    - main.*\n    - logic_test.*\n\n`main.*` contains the functions that handle the web requests. `logic.*`\ncontains the snake logic; how your snake responds given a game state.\n`logic_test.*` contains some tests for functions defined in `logic.*`.\nIn the next two sections I’ll discuss the code in these files. Again, it\nwill be done in Go, but you should be able to follow in any language\nsince the structure is similar.\n\n#### Web requests\n\nOpening `main.go` file will show a couple of functions and structs. The\nfunctions are for handling web requests, and the structs show how the\ndata should be **parsed** from the incoming web request. All these data\nstructures have to do with the `GameState` that we get from a request at\nthe `/move` endpoint.\n\nWe can see four different handlers:\n\n``` go\nfunc HandleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  [...]\n}\n\nfunc HandleStart(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  [...]\n}\n\nfunc HandleMove(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  [...]\n}\n\nfunc HandleEnd(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n  [...]\n}\n```\n\nEach one corresponds to a different end point. Here, `HandleIndex`\ncorresponds to the `/`, or **root**, endpoint. The reason that this is\ncalled `HandleIndex` and not `HandleRoot`, is because when you normally\ntype a URL, for example `duckduckgo.com`, you don’t actually go to the\nroot. You browser automatically starts looking for a file called\n`index.html` on the corresponding website (i.e.\n`duckduckgo.com/index.html`). In its simplest form, a website is nothing\nmore than a server that serves `html` files. Which is also why `/` is\ncalled the root, because **it is the root of the filesystem of the\nserver**.\n\n#### Trying it out\n\nTo check if the server runs like it should (and it should), you can run\nthe project in whatever IDE you have. In Go, using the command line, it\nwould look like this:\n\n``` bash\ngo run main.go\n```\n\n``` txt\n2022/03/23 21:10:03 Starting Battlesnake Server at http://0.0.0.0:8080...\n```\n\nOpen your browser and type in the URL at the end of the line (or,\n`http://localhost:8080`, they mean the same). If everything works as it\nshould, you should see something like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"apiversion\": \"1\",\n  \"author\": \"cochaviz\",\n  \"color\": \"#488A16\",\n  \"head\": \"beluga\",\n  \"tail\": \"curled\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is the ‘secret’ endpoint I was hinting at in the previous chapter!\nIt tells us information about who made the snake (me :smile:), what it\nlooks like, and the version of the API. Knowing the version of the API\nis important because it tells you if it even makes sense to interact\nwith the snake any further. If the Battlesnake game server would see a\ndifferent API version, it would probably not interact any further (maybe\nshow you an error when creating the snake) in order to avoid possible\nerrors.\n\nThis is essentially what the Heroku server will do. It will take the\ncode from GitHub and run it. The only difference is that the URL will be\ndifferent than `http://0.0.0.0:8080`. This address is actually only\naccessible from your computer (hinted to by `localhost`) in order to\nmake sure no malicious users could gain access to your computer.\nTechnically you *could* host it yourself (and once you know a little bit\nmore about networking and hosting I would highly encourage you to do\nso!), but for now Heroku is the simplest *and* safest option.\n\n#### Snake logic\n\nHaving a look in the `logic.go` shows only a couple of functions, but a\nlot of comments. This is where most of the magic will happen, at least,\nin the beginning. Once you make your snake more complex, you will\ninevitably restructure your project. But, it is a nice place to start\nfrom.
