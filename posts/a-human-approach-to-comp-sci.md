## Introduction

Currently, I am working on my bachelor's thesis (fingers crossed that I'll be
done this year 🙏). It is about how we could make automated negotiations fairer,
which required reading papers about philosophical ideas on fairness as provided
by my supervisor. Being very excited to learn about something else than how to
analyze the time complexity of some dynamic programming algorithm, I started
reading right away.

## Humanities are weird

To my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and wordy. There
were a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn't understand. There was
never a sense of arrival; no, aha moment. Barely a problem. I'll just read more
slowly and look up the terms. No, not so quick! It seems like everyone has their
own definition of egalitarianism, the 'right' interpretation of a certain work,
and don't even get me started about the difference between the European and
American usage of liberal.

What I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it seemed like my
understanding of the subject didn't grow as much as the amount seemed to suggest
that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt like a
never-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out what the author
actually meant. It's also not as if I had never read any philosophical works or
books on subjects other than computer science. It was, however, not something I
expected to encounter in literature necessary for a computer science research
paper :confused:.

## Computer science isn't human

Computer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with a
question and follow some logic to arrive at an answer. This, I believe, is
probably a result of computer science being a derivative of mathematics[^1] and
other exact sciences. Of course, this depends on which field in computer science
you're exactly working in, but I think most people can agree that any computer
science paper (or even a tutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot
more confidence about the subject than scientific work in humanities.

However, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems like the
way information in exact sciences is presented in a way that makes a bit too
much sense. We've all heard the math teacher tell us that "You shouldn't just
study the answers to the problem". Instead, you should try and figure it out by
messing around, encountering dead ends, etc. Learning is messy. This, however,
is the complete opposite of how information is presented in textbooks, papers,
and textbooks. Giving students and the general public the idea that if you can't
find the answer immediately, you're doing something wrong. Now, of course,
researchers, teachers, and people who enjoyed a higher education know that this
is not the case; they're familiar with the fact that learning is messy. But this
is not a given to anyone without a master's degree, especially not to the
general public who just hear about another great scientific discovery. Bringing
us to the 'messy' papers I had to read.

[^1]: Back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics major, instead of the more engineering-oriented subject we know it as today.

## Humanities make sense

Philosophers present the material exactly as they are thinking about it; you are
forced to think with them. Of course, this doesn't make sense. Heck, when have
your raw thoughts ever made complete sense to another human being. Most of the
time, you're forced to rephrase when talking to someone about a complex topic.
Not always, but the important thing is that it's never a clear-cut logical
argument- and that's when you really have to start thinking about what it is you
want to say. That's when you're learning. At least, according to Richard
Feynman.

Presenting your information in a way that encourages the learning process as
much as possible makes total sense. The value of your work inherently driving
your readers to think about what you are trying to say is something which, I
think, is vastly underestimated. Even if that means that the information isn't
easily digestible; sometimes it shouldn't be. Now, I don't want to do a simple
appeal to authority saying that because some smart person said this is the best
way to learn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some
value in Richard Feynman suggesting this is the most crucial step in learning.

[^2]: This isn't a direct quote, but something called the 'Feynman Method'. The
    method Richard Feynman said he used to learn about new subjects.

## Computer science should strive to be more human

So, do I think we should all abandon the current state of affairs and just start
submitting cryptic diaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides that just being a
ridiculous proposition, I also made gross oversimplifications and
generalizations; not all philosophical write like I described before -
definitely not all people doing research in humanities. I do, however, think we
should pay more attention to how information is presented to people.

The way an author writes can have a massive impact on how the information
presented is perceived and digested. Writing in such a way that the reader
actively thinks about the subject -while not discouraging them to finish the
material- is tremendously difficult, but absolutely worth it. Find the balance
between vagueness and clarity. How best to find that balance is left as an
exercise for the reader.
