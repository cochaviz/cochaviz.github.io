## Introduction

Currently, I am working on my bachelor’s thesis (fingers crossed that
I’ll be done this year 🙏). It is about how we could make automated
negotiations fairer, which required reading papers about philosophical
ideas on fairness as provided by my supervisor. Being very excited to
learn about something else than how to analyze the time complexity of
some dynamic programming algorithm, I started reading right away.

## Humanities are weird

To my disappointment, it was weird. Statements were convoluted and
wordy. There were a lot of concepts and terminology which I didn’t
understand. There was never a sense of arrival; no, aha moment. Barely a
problem. I’ll just read more slowly and look up the terms. No, not so
quick! It seems like everyone has their own definition of
egalitarianism, the ‘right’ interpretation of a certain work, and don’t
even get me started about the difference between the European and
American usage of liberal.

What I did pick up from reading I really enjoyed, but it seemed like my
understanding of the subject didn’t grow as much as the amount seemed to
suggest that it should. Attempting to understand certain arguments felt
like a never-ending battle with text, desperately trying to figure out
what the author actually meant. It’s also not as if I had never read any
philosophical works or books on subjects other than computer science. It
was, however, not something I expected to encounter in literature
necessary for a computer science research paper :confused:.

## Computer science isn’t human

Computer science literature -in general- has a clear path; we start with
a question and follow some logic to arrive at an answer. This, I
believe, is probably a result of computer science being a derivative of
mathematics[^1] and other exact sciences. Of course, this depends on
which field in computer science you’re exactly working in, but I think
most people can agree that any computer science paper (or even a
tutorial for that matter) will leave you with a lot more confidence
about the subject than scientific work in humanities.

However, the more I learn about practically anything, the more it seems
like the way information in exact sciences is presented in a way that
makes a bit too much sense. We’ve all heard the math teacher tell us
that “You shouldn’t just study the answers to the problem”. Instead, you
should try and figure it out by messing around, encountering dead ends,
etc. Learning is messy. This, however, is the complete opposite of how
information is presented in textbooks, papers, and textbooks. Giving
students and the general public the idea that if you can’t find the
answer immediately, you’re doing something wrong. Now, of course,
researchers, teachers, and people who enjoyed a higher education know
that this is not the case; they’re familiar with the fact that learning
is messy. But this is not a given to anyone without a master’s degree,
especially not to the general public who just hear about another great
scientific discovery. Bringing us to the ‘messy’ papers I had to read.

## Humanities make sense

Philosophers present the material exactly as they are thinking about it;
you are forced to think with them. Of course, this doesn’t make sense.
Heck, when have your raw thoughts ever made complete sense to another
human being. Most of the time, you’re forced to rephrase when talking to
someone about a complex topic. Not always, but the important thing is
that it’s never a clear-cut logical argument- and that’s when you really
have to start thinking about what it is you want to say. That’s when
you’re learning. At least, according to Richard Feynman.

Presenting your information in a way that encourages the learning
process as much as possible makes total sense. The value of your work
inherently driving your readers to think about what you are trying to
say is something which, I think, is vastly underestimated. Even if that
means that the information isn’t easily digestible; sometimes it
shouldn’t be. Now, I don’t want to do a simple appeal to authority
saying that because some smart person said this is the best way to
learn, it is the best way to learn. I do, however, think there is some
value in Richard Feynman suggesting this is the most crucial step in
learning.

## Computer science should strive to be more human

So, do I think we should all abandon the current state of affairs and
just start submitting cryptic diaries to Nature? Of course not. Besides
that just being a ridiculous proposition, I also made gross
oversimplifications and generalizations; not all philosophical write
like I described before - definitely not all people doing research in
humanities. I do, however, think we should pay more attention to how
information is presented to people.

The way an author writes can have a massive impact on how the
information presented is perceived and digested. Writing in such a way
that the reader actively thinks about the subject -while not
discouraging them to finish the material- is tremendously difficult, but
absolutely worth it. Find the balance between vagueness and clarity. How
best to find that balance is left as an exercise for the reader.

[^1]: Back in the day, it was only taught as part of a mathematics
    major, instead of the more engineering-oriented subject we know it
    as today.

[^2]: This isn’t a direct quote, but something called the ‘Feynman
    Method’. The method Richard Feynman said he used to learn about new
    subjects.
