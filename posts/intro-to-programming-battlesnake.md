## Introduction

In this guide I'll walk you through concepts of programming and application
development by example of an AI  that will play the game
[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/). The aim of this tutorial is to
help you step beyond the 'programming a calculator' phase. You know what
language you want to learn, have a grasp of basic syntax and know how logic in
programming works (e.g. if statements). But what now? Well, writing an AI
:sunglasses:. We will cover:

- problem representation and solving
- version control with [git](https://git-scm.com) and
  [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- some high-level concepts regarding web services and
  [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
- setting up a server with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

Battlesnake is a great place to start from. Firstly, because it touches upon a
lot of different concepts in software development.  Secondly, your AI will
battle against that of other people and there are leaderboards to show you how
well it performs. This means that you can see your snake improve with your
programming abilities!

I can hear you ask: "Great, but what language are we gonna be programming in?".
Since we are essentially creating a [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)
service](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service>), you can do this in any
language you want!  The Battlesnake devs and the community have created some
[starter projects](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects)
which will help you get started in minutes. If you language is in there, great!
Otherwise, don't worry.  I'll be explaining everything in [Go](https://go.dev/),
but the concepts are the same so you can follow along in any language.  I
understand it might be confusing to understand what is language-specific and
what isn't, so I'll make sure keep concepts and  implementation separate.

### Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes that you are a beginner, but that you have some basic
knowledge about programming.  More specifically, you

- **have an environment** in which you can write and run code (i.e. an IDE)
- **know how use logic** in you programming language of choice (e.g. if-statements)
- know how to use any of: **classes/objects/structs** (if you language supports
  those)
- **have made a couple of small practice projects** (not necessary, but highly
  recommended for fluency)

If some of these don't apply to you, I would highly encourage you to pick up a
basic course on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) or follow some
tutorials on youtube. Create your first couple of little projects, and then come
back! Do feel free to keep on looking, maybe you're a lot smarter than you (or
I) think you are.

### Structure

We will cover a wide range of topics, so I will try to keep the structure as
consistent and easy to follow as possible.  Like mentioned before, while I will
be using Go to illustrate examples, I will try to keep all language-dependent
parts separate.

First, I'll introduce the game, Battlesnake, rules and the different tools we'll
need.  Then we'll touch upon web services and APIs; how our application will
communicate with the Battlesnake server.  Following that, I'll introduce
software to manage different versions of your code, and a platform to upload
your code to.  Finally, we will spin up a server which will use the code we've
uploaded previously to run our snake on!

You are, of course, free to stop at any moment and resume at a later date.
Actually, I highly encourage this! Take breaks regularly, especially if things
don't seem to work when they should... :bug:. We'll cover a lot of material, so
buckle up, grab some snacks, and let's get going :rocket:!

## Battlesnake

> Battlesnake is a multi-player programming game played by developers all over
> the world. All you need to play is a live web server that implements the
> Battlesnake API.

[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) is a developer-oriented game,
meaning that everything in, about, and around the game is made by developers,
for developers. This means that there are a lot of resources out there that can
help us out.  Best example is, of course, the original [Battlesnake
documentation](https://docs.battlesnake.com/), which I encourage you to read and
refer to whenever you're lost before trying to _DuckDuck Go_ it.

### How Battlesnake works

The Battlesnake game rules are simple. In the default game mode, the goal is to
be the last-snake-standing among a group of  three other snakes. Besides that,
the normal rules of snake apply:

1. don't run into walls
2. don't run into snakes (you and others)
3. eating food makes you grow :apple:

There are some other edge-cases to consider (e.g. what do you do when heads
collide), but these don't matter much for our purposes. Please refer to the
official documentation if you want to learn more.

### Creating our first snake

Enough talking! Let's create a snake! To do this, we'll first need to create an
account. One option is to create an account with GitHub. Choose this one. Like
mentioned before, we'll use this platform to host our code, so we need an
account for that anyway. [Create an account](https://github.com/signup) for
GitHub, then head over to Battlesnake to [create an
account](https://play.battlesnake.com/login/) and select the **Sign in with
GitHub** button.

Awesome, now we can head over to Battlesnake to [create a new
snake](https://play.battlesnake.com/account/snakes/create/ ). Give it a name (I
name my snakes after Lord of the Rings characters)! And... Huh? A URL? Yes, a
URL. This is where the fun begins. For now we'll cancel, since the URL is a
required field, but head to next section and I'll explain what's going on.

### How Battlesnake _actually_ works

The reason why we need to provide a URL when creating a snake, is because the
snake is essentially a [web service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service).
I briefly mentioned this in the introduction, but now I'll elaborate on what
that actually means.

To put it concretely, our snake will run on its own remote computer (server),
the Battlesnake game server will send us the current state of the game (location
of all the snake, food, size of the field, etc.) and ask us what our next move
is.  We then send a response (indicated `{response}` in the diagram), this
simply contains the action: "up", "down", "left", or "right". But for the
Battlesnake server to reach us we to tell it our location, the URL. If you would
this manually, this is the equivalent of typing the URL, let's say
`my-awesome-snake.dev`, and appending `/move` to it, giving us
`my-awesome-snake.dev/move`. This is what we call an
[endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_endpoint). There is also
a endpoint for indicating that we want to start to game, which would be
`my-awesome-snake.dev/start`. And one for ending the game, `/end`. You get the
idea.

![transaction
diagram](/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/transaction-diagram.svg
"Transaction diagram of the requests and responses made during a Battlesnake
game. Here to the endpoints `/start`, `/move`, and `/end`")

As you can imagine, there is no real need to send any info back to the
Battlesnake server when it send a web-request to our snake on `/end`, telling it
to end the game. But we do definitely need to send a response when we've been
asked to make a move. Just like we really need to receive some information about
the game, for example, what moves the others have made. The specification for
what type of requests we need to handle (does the request contain information?
Do we need to send anything back; give a response?), as well as the format that
the information is in (e.g. a two-dimensional array representing the board) is
called an [Application Programming Interface, or
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).

Having an API is great, because it means that **two programs can
communicate, without them needing to know exactly how the other works**. Since
the only import thing is that they know what to expect when they ask the other
something. Just as they know what to provide in order to make sure the other can
successfully perform their required task. This is exactly the reason why you
should be able to program in any language you want! **As long as you adhere to
the API specification, you can implement your snake in anything you want**.

Of course, the Battlesnake documentation also [contains a specification for the
API of the snake](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api). Go and see if
you can find the endpoints mentioned before.  There is actually one more
endpoint I didn't mention, try to see if you can find it and figure out what it
does!

## Getting the server running

All right, this is where most of the work is gonna take place, so I'll just tell
you right now what to expect and how we're gonna do it. First, we'll take one of
the beginner projects that I've mentioned before. All of them are on GitHub, and
with just one button we can have our own version of such a so-called
**template** to work with. Then, we'll make sure we have a local version of that
code. This is done with git, which I'll also introduce then (in short, it allows
us to keep track of different versions of our code and lets us sync our local
version with a remote one, in our case GitHub). Once we've got that going, we
will look at Heroku. This is a service that will host our code on a publicly
accessible URL, which will allow us to create our first snake! Once all of this
is set up we will be able to start programming our snake logic. With that said,
let's get going!

### Creating your first repository

Going back to the [starter
projects](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/starter-projects), click on
the one that you would like to use. This should bring you to GitHub, where you
will click the big green button saying _**"Use this template"**_. Give it a name,
keep it public, and click _**"Create repository from template"**_.
Congratulations! You have made your first repository  :partying_face:!  "But
what is a repository?", I can hear you ask. Well, let me explain.

#### Git primer

A repository is a folder in which [git]() tracks changes in order to organize
the history of your code. And what is git? Well, it simply is a tool to organize
the history, or, the different versions of you code, a [Version Control
System, or VCS](). It allows you to **commit** changes in batches, and requires
you to title and describe each of these batches, or **commits**. Now, let's say
you would like to see if a particular feature would work well. You don't want to
accidentally break your precious program, so you **branch** off to a different
version. In this new branch, you write your code and continue to make commits.
You are a great programmer, so your feature turns out to be a great addition to
the existing program! Now you can **merge** the new feature branch with the
**main** (from which we've originally branched off) one.

![git history
diagram](/images/post/intro-to-programming-battlesnake/git-history-diagram.svg
"An example of a git history tree. After the first commit on the `main` branch,
a new feature is tested on a new branch. In the merge, the commits made to the
`new-feature` branch are applied to the `main` branch.")

GitHub comes in when you would like to work together with other people (or just
have a non-local backup). It is simply a repository stored on the GitHub
servers. If you want to edit code on a repository you would first **clone** the
repository to you local machine. In this local version you would keep track of
your changes like normal, commit similar batches of changes and branching if
need be. At any point, you can choose to **push** your changes to the **remote**
repository on GitHub. This is why it is important to always **pull** before
starting to code on a collaborative project, since someone might have changed
the same code you want to work on. If you don't do this, you might encounter
**conflicts** when you want to push the changes you made to the remote.

#### Working with git

Now, there are a couple of different options in with regard to performing these
actions on a local version of your new repository. There are applications with
a **graphical user interface (GUI)** such as

- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - easiest to use in combination
  with GitHub
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - has a _ton_ of features
- [and many more...](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

Personally, I like using the command line ([git
bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows) to use git.  If you don't have
any experience using a **command line interface (CLI)**, I suggest you take one
of the options that includes a GUI. I, however, will be giving explaining what
to do using command line instructions. Which would looks something like this

```bash
git add changed_file.go
git commit -m "Commit #1"
```

Here, I'm adding all my changes from a file called `changed_file.go`, and then
committing them in a new commit called _Commit #1_. If you would like to know
how to do that in your git application of choice, simply _DuckDuck Go_ something
along the lines of _"how to add on GitHub Desktop"_ and _"how to commit on Github
Desktop"_. It might be a little hard at first, but I believe you'll learn more
about the application and how to work with it if you find the solution yourself.

### Exploring the code base

Let's get a little taste of what we're gonna be working with and check if
everything works as it should, before starting to set up our server. In order to
check out the code, we could of course go to repository on GitHub and browse the
code from there. But if we want to make changes, we'll have to have it locally.
So let's do that now.

```bash
# this will clone the repository <repo> of <username> into the folder <local_repo>
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git <local_repo>
```

This will give us a folder, which we can open with our favorite IDE (mine is
emacs). All the beginner projects have a similar structure of which these are
the most important files.

```
# A wildcard (*) indicates any sort of pattern (e.g. py, go, rs, etc.)
- logic.*
- main.*
- logic_test.*
```

`main.*` contains the functions that handle the web requests. `logic.*` contains
the snake logic; how your snake responds given a game state. `logic_test.*`
contains some tests for functions defined in `logic.*`. In the next two sections
I'll discuss the code in these files. Again, it will be done in Go, but you
should be able to follow in any language since the structure is similar.

#### Web requests

Opening `main.go` file will show a couple of functions and structs. The functions are
for handling web requests, and the structs show how the data should be
**parsed** from the incoming web request. All these data structures have to do
with the `GameState` that we get from a request at the `/move` endpoint.

We can see four different handlers:

```go
func HandleIndex(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  [...]
}

func HandleStart(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  [...]
}

func HandleMove(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  [...]
}

func HandleEnd(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  [...]
}
```

Each one corresponds to a different end point. Here, `HandleIndex` corresponds
to the `/`, or **root**, endpoint. The reason that this is called `HandleIndex`
and not `HandleRoot`, is because when you normally type a URL, for example
`duckduckgo.com`, you don't actually go to the root. You browser automatically
starts looking for a file called `index.html` on the corresponding website (i.e.
`duckduckgo.com/index.html`). In its simplest form, a website is nothing more
than a server that serves `html` files. Which is also why `/` is called the
root, because **it is the root of the filesystem of the server**.

#### Trying it out

To check if the server runs like it should (and it should), you can run the
project in whatever IDE you have. In Go, using the command line, it would look
like this:

```bash
go run main.go
```

```txt
2022/03/23 21:10:03 Starting Battlesnake Server at http://0.0.0.0:8080...
```

Open your browser and type in the URL at the end of the line
(or, `http://localhost:8080`, they mean the same). If everything works as it
should, you should see something like this:

```json
{
  "apiversion": "1",
  "author": "cochaviz",
  "color": "#488A16",
  "head": "beluga",
  "tail": "curled"
}
```

This is the 'secret' endpoint I was hinting at in the previous chapter! It tells
us information about who made the snake (me :smile:), what it looks like, and
the version of the API. Knowing the version of the API is important because it
tells you if it even makes sense to interact with the snake any further. If the
Battlesnake game server would see a different API version, it would probably not
interact any further (maybe show you an error when creating the snake) in order
to avoid possible errors.

This is essentially what the Heroku server will do. It will take the code from
GitHub and run it. The only difference is that the URL will be different than
`http://0.0.0.0:8080`. This address is actually only accessible from your
computer (hinted to by `localhost`) in order to make sure no malicious users
could gain access to your computer. Technically you _could_ host it yourself
(and once you know a little bit more about networking and hosting I would highly
encourage you to do so!), but for now Heroku is the simplest _and_ safest option.

#### Snake logic

Having a look in the `logic.go` shows only a couple of functions, but a lot of
comments. This is where most of the magic will happen, at least, in the
beginning. Once you make your snake more complex, you will inevitably
restructure your project. But, it is a nice place to start from. Let's have a
look together, but do make sure to read through the comments first to see if you
understand what they are supposed to do.

```go
// This function is called when you register your Battlesnake on play.battlesnake.com
// See https://docs.battlesnake.com/guides/getting-started#step-4-register-your-battlesnake
// It controls your Battlesnake appearance and author permissions.
// For customization options, see https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/personalization
// TIP: If you open your Battlesnake URL in browser you should see this data.
func info() BattlesnakeInfoResponse {
  [...]
}

// This function is called everytime your Battlesnake is entered into a game.
// The provided GameState contains information about the game that's about to be played.
// It's purely for informational purposes, you don't have to make any decisions here.
func start(state GameState) {
  [...]
}

// This function is called when a game your Battlesnake was in has ended.
// It's purely for informational purposes, you don't have to make any decisions here.
func end(state GameState) {
  [...]
}

// This function is called on every turn of a game. Use the provided GameState to decide
// where to move -- valid moves are "up", "down", "left", or "right".
// We've provided some code and comments to get you started.
func move(state GameState) BattlesnakeMoveResponse {
  [...]

 // Step 0: Don't let your Battlesnake move back in on it's own neck

  [...]

 // TODO: Step 1 - Don't hit walls.

 // TODO: Step 2 - Don't hit yourself.

 // TODO: Step 3 - Don't collide with others.

 // TODO: Step 4 - Find food.

 // TODO: Step 5 - Select a move to make based on strategy, rather than random.
  
  [...]
}
```
